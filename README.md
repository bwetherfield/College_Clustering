# Coursera/IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

This is the repository for my Coursera/IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Submission. It is the final instalment of a 9-course Professional Certificate in Data Science housed by Coursera with course content provided by IBM.

## Overview 
For this capstone project, I have chosen to do some exploratory data science investigating how we can group colleges with similar towns and environments! Ultimately, my aim here is to find useful ways to quantify campus "feel" which is a word that gets thrown around a lot when discussing finding the right college (as a student, or a professional counselor or education consultant).
