# Coursera Capstone

Repository for my Coursera/IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Submission.

## Overview 
As my project, I have chosen to do some exploratory data science investigating how we can group colleges with similar towns and environments! Ultimately, my aim here is to find useful ways to quantify campus "feel" which is a word that gets thrown around a lot when discussing finding the right college (as a student, or a professional counselor or education consultant).
